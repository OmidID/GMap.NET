# GMap.NET - Maps For Windows

![GMap.Net](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judero01col/GMap.NET/master/GMap.ico "this is the result")

GMap.NET Windows Forms & Presentation is an excellent open source, powerful, free and cross-platform .NET control.
Allows the use of routing, geocoding, directions and maps from Google, Yahoo!, Bing, OpenStreetMap, ArcGIS, Pergo, SigPac, Yendux, Mapy.cz, Maps.lt, iKarte.lv, NearMap, HereMap, CloudMade, WikiMapia, MapQuest and many more.

# Installing
GMap.NET is available as a Nuget package from:

https://www.nuget.org/packages/GMap.NET.Core

https://www.nuget.org/packages/GMap.NET.WinForms

If you wish to use the cutting-edge version of gmaps-api-net, then you can clone the repository (or download the zip) and build the class library yourself. This should require minimal set-up, and also allows you to develop extra features for your own use (or to push upstream using a pull request for everyone else to use!).
